1	 as indicated by the fact that she took out and paid for insurance on the houses even after the execution of the deed. when she returned to warwick in 1956 she was not dependent financially on her son, nor did she rely on him entirely or even primarily for the taking care of her other needs. she was attended to by a colored woman who apparently had done this over the years. she ordered her own groceries by telephone and the ministrations of her son seem to have been no more than occasionally *131 sleeping in the house when she otherwise would have been alone. no unusual reliance would seem to have been placed by the mother on the son and their relationship revealed by the record does not appear to be other than that of a normal and customary one between an elderly mother and a grown son. compare masius v. wilson, 213 md. 259; piraino v. betka, 218 md. 548. if no confidential relationship was proven, the testimony would seem clearly to fall short of that necessary to show that undue influence caused the execution of the deed. if the burden of proof of undue influence remained on the complainant, as it would if confidential relations were not properly proven, the invalidity of the deed would not be established except by proof of coercion, that is, "that degree of importunity which deprives a testator of his free agency, which is such as he is too weak to resist, and will render the instrument not his free and unconstrained act." sellers v. qualls, 206 md. 58, 70. the testimony as to mental incapacity is equally inconclusive. true the attending physician did testify that he thought she was incapable of making decisions or a valid deed on the day in question, but his reason would seem to have been that she was so physically ill. there was no suggestion of mental disease or disorder. the doctor's expressed specific reason for believing her incompetent was that he had prescribed phenobarbitol on the 24th and that this would dull the mental faculties.

(hymenoptera: apidae) promoted by topical application of juvenile hormone. the present study analyzed, the influence of the treatment with juvenile hormone on the ultrastructure of apis mellifera l. workers' venom glands. newly emerged workers received topical application of 1 microl of juvenile hormone diluted in hexane, in the concentration of 2 microg/pl. two controls were used; one control received no treatment (group c1) and other received topical application of 1 microl of hexane (group c2). the aspect of the glandular cells, in not treated newly emerged workers, showed that they are not yet secreting actively. cellular modifications happened according to the worker age and to the glandular area considered. the most active phase of the gland happened from the emergence to the 14th day. at the 25th day the cells had already lost their secretory characteristic, being the distal area the first to suffer degeneration. the treatment with juvenile hormone and hexane altered the temporal sequence of the glandular cycle, forwarding the secretory cycle and degeneration of the venom gland.
7	perhaps the clearest indication of who won and lost came quickly on the heels of the event itself: the democratic post-debate message was that joe biden scored a clear win; the republican message was that joe biden was too mean to paul ryan. the former is a boast of success; the latter is an excuse for failure. in the larger context, it’s hard to overstate how much democrats needed a shot in the arm like this. the surface-level goals of any vice presidential debate is for the candidates to demonstrate a capacity to step up in the event of a crisis, while defending their ticket’s agenda and knocking their rivals’ agenda. but for biden, the overarching benefit was about the basic morale of his party with less than four weeks to go until election day: he wanted to give democratic voters something to feel good about, and he did. who the hell am i! i’m a liberal that is extreme in some ways and not in others. i support president obama and make no apologies for it. i think he has done a phenomenal job, especially when you consider that he inherited a huge mess and has faced unprecedented opposition from a lazy & desperate republican party. i’m a film producer/director/editor, adjunct professor, technician, media critic and photographer when i’m not reading left wing blogs and typing on this one. – on twitter @extremeliberal or email at liberalforreal (at) gmail.com own an important part of american history! cicely tyson narrates this award winning documentary that tells the story of african american migration from the old south to the prosperous north. winner of 5 awards including "best film" at the astoria international film festival, the "paul robeson award" at the newark black film festival and "best film relating to the black experience" at the xxv international black cinema berlin/germany!
8	 it just took the right moment.” that moment came in round 9, when szpilka attempted to blast "the bronze bomber” with a big left hand. wilder countered with an even bigger right hand as the southpaw stepped forward, walking straight into a blow square on his jaw. szpilka’s body immediately went slack as he crumpled to the canvas, arms outstretched over his head in a grim, glassy-eyed pose. “when you get hit solid with this right hand, it’s bad news,” wilder says. “i have something that can end a person’s career.” szpilka was carried out of the ring on a stretcher and taken to a local hospital as a precautionary measure, but shields indicated afterward that his fighter was ok. “he was conscious. he was talking. he was good,” he said. amid all the action at the end of the bout, recently crowned heavyweight champ tyson fury, who was watching the fight ringside, bounded into the fray and jawed with wilder, who branded fury a phony and a grandstander as he traded heated barbs with the bear-sized brit. “i just wasn’t in a playing mood,” wilder said of fury’s antics. “we’ve got a man going to the hospital, nothing to play around with, and he’s trying to promote a fight that’s not even in reach yet. he doesn’t even know if he’s going to win his next fight [an unscheduled rematch with wladimir klitschko]. “but i’m so ready [to fight fury],” he added. “it’s not even funny. i’m tired of talking, tired of playing around with tyson fury. i’m ready to get that fight on. the heavyweight division is exciting again.” charles martin gained a heavyweight title with a third-round stoppage of vyacheslav glazkov, who suffered a knee injury and was unable to continue.

9	way too early nit bracketology (via ebs) it’s obviously still way too early to start projecting the ncaa tournament or nit brackets, but… let’s do it anyways! i took drew cannon’s easy bubble solver and used it to take a look at what the nit field might look like—assuming all the highest ranked kenpom teams win their conference tournaments. (i’m using projected rpi from rpi forecast and the current kenpom ranking in case you’re curious.) the tool isn’t necessarily designed for this case—and it’s super early in the season—but it’s still gives a good sense for which power conference teams might be in more trouble than you think early in the season. the biggest surprise in this bracket for me was just how far down in the pecking order maryland finds itself. the terrapins are projected to finish around 95th in rpi, even though they’re currently 7-1 (6-1 against division i opponents). the discrepancy between maryland’s record and its status in kenpom (64th, 9th in the big ten) is causing some big disagreements with bracketologists. the terrapins are a 10 seed in joe lunardi’s current bracket, but a six seed in the projected bracket below. another major conference team that the ncaa bracketologists seem to be higher on than the ebs is colorado. the buffaloes are currently an 11 seed in lunardi, but a 5 seed in the nit here. colorado’s pac-12 conferencemate california is also higher in lunardi’s bracket. the golden bears are a 2 seed in the nit via the ebs, but in the first four in lunardi’s. also, shaka smart is going to have a lot of work to do if texas wants to make the ncaa tournament, right now even the nit seems like a bit of a challenge. the longhorns are 70th in kenpom and have a projected rpi of 126th. considering that the final 8-12 spots in the nit bracket will likely be taken by top seeds that lose in their conference tournament, some big name teams could end up missing the postseason altogether.

11	 "was this text legit?" the firm's head of investor relations wrote to mr musk's chief of staff, the complaint says. 'significant confusion' tesla shares soared after mr musk's announcement, before retreating amid questions and doubts. weeks later, mr musk backed away from the plan, citing investor feedback. the sec, which is also seeking financial penalties, said his claims created "significant confusion" in the stock market and harmed investors. media playback is unsupported on your device media caption tesla's elon musk 'mislead investors' sec alleges "taking care to provide truthful and accurate information is among a ceo's most critical obligations," said stephanie avakian, co-director of the sec's enforcement division. "that standard applies with equal force when the communications are made via social media or another non-traditional form." the sec complaint sent shares of the firm down by more than 10% in after-hours trade. analysis dave lee, bbc north america technology reporter, san francisco: whatever the state of mind elon musk was in when he announced he had "funding secured", it could end up costing almost everything he holds dear. it would be nobody's fault but his own. wall street veterans - and indeed, anyone with a modicum of knowledge of how the financial markets work - predicted this very scenario the moment those tweets were posted. mr musk is famously an unconventional chief executive, but when it comes to the financial markets, you can't flout the rules without serious consequences. it's clear, from emails contained in the sec's filing, that staff at tesla were caught completely off guard. his head of investor relations asked if the tweets were "legit". the nasdaq, confused, halted trading. it all makes mr musk unfit to run a public company, the sec says. all this because of a tweet sent because mr musk thought his girlfriend "would find it funny". image copyright getty images image caption mr musk is credited with pushing the car industry toward electric vehicles mr musk, who co-founded tesla and has served as chief executive since 2008, is a divisive figure in the business world, who has inspired passionate fans and critics. supporters credit mr musk, also the head of the rocket company spacex, with pushing the car industry to produce electric cars.

13	 as a name throughout news corp, lachlan is almost as redolent as rupert. still, if there is within the company an absolute belief in a forthcoming succession and in the murdochs as royalty, a people apart, there is, too, an obvious and constant comparison between once and future. if in australia lachlan was regarded as a clever, sophisticated guy - a tastemaker - and a good manager who built a strong rapport in newsrooms and with his executives, in the us the perception is that he was a weak, even pitiable, version of his dad. he was too sensitive; he was petulant; he lacked charm; he was not sharp. formally, his title at news ltd was chief executive. both in name and in practice, he ran news ltd's entire operations, overseeing all its newspapers and its pay television joint venture. in new york, his official title was deputy chief operating officer, which was meant to give him control of news corp's us publications - the post - and make him peter chernin's deputy at fox. the father in small but constant ways humiliated the son, which made him a joke to everybody else. in every meeting the father was the impatient, domineering, fussing presence. he couldn't stop calling attention to himself and away from the son. at the same time, the son, stamping his foot, was trying to call attention to himself. he started marketing campaigns for the post; tried to bring a little class to a notoriously unclassy operation by throwing functions and parties in the tabloid's name. over on the west coast, he hung out with movie stars and insisted his dad make smarter and hipper movies (fight club, which rupert detested, was a lachlan-supported project). "family businesses are great businesses," lachlan says, "but they're, they're also fraught with difficulties, so, um, so the, uh... i think because you go back to that fundamental character trait that has served dad so well, which is forward thinking and always driving forward, i think he, um, misunderstood - doesn't understand or appreciate sometimes, or he does, but doesn't think about how complicated they are

15	gia-aneurysmorrhaphy and dermal detachment: a novel technique to repair arteriovenous fistula aneurysms. this report describes a simplified technique for management of aneurysmal arteriovenous fistulas along with results of initial clinical experience in 12 patients. various techniques have been described which seek to repair the arteriovenous fistula and lengthen its duration of use. here, we introduce the gia-aneurysmorrhaphy and dermal detachment (gadd) procedure, a novel technique which requires minimal dissection to decompress tension on the overlying skin. transverse incisions were made proximally and distally to the aneurysmal segment, which was then bluntly dissected along its length on either side. a gia stapler is then fired along the longitudinal axis, narrowing the lumen of the fistula and separating the aneurysm from the skin. after the operation, the arteriovenous fistulae were used continuously until death (1 patient for 12 months), until thrombosis (1 patient for 13 months), or continue to be in use (9 patients, mean patency 18 months). one patient underwent conversion to open aneurysmorrhaphy due to intraoperative fistula occlusion. five patients resumed hemodialysis immediately, while the remaining resumed hemodialysis within 3 months. the most common complication was cellulitis (3 patients). the gadd procedure as described in this report offers an effective and low-risk option for the management of venous aneurysms with threatened skin in hemodialysis patients.

17	 we do not mean to infer that a trial court could not award fees in the amount called for by the contingency agreement if, after consideration of factors such as number of hours spent on the case, reasonable hourly compensation for the attorney, novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, skill displayed in presenting them, extent to which the litigation precluded other employment by the attorney, and the contingent nature of the fee award, the court finds the sum reasonable. (see, e.g., glendora community redevelopment agency v. demeter, supra, 155 cal. app.3d 465.) (11b) however, the starting point of every fee award must be a calculation of the attorney's services in terms of time actually expended on the case. (serrano v. priest (1977) 20 cal.3d 25, 48, fn. 23 [141 cal. rptr. 315, 569 p.2d 1303].) landowners allege the amount awarded, i.e., $30,000, bears no rational relationship to the amount requested because their declaration of hours times hourly rate was $37,512.50. however, their addition is faulty; the correct total is $21,462.50. it is conceivable, therefore, that the court did consider factors in addition to actual time spent in making its award. additionally, the court did indicate that it was allowing no amount "for activity related to collection of attorney fees." (12a) it has been held that when an award of attorneys' fees is statutorily authorized, the reasonable expenses of preparing the fee application should be included in the award. (brown v. fairleigh dickinson university (d.n.j. 1983) 560 f. supp. 391, 414.) efforts in opposing a motion to tax costs are recoverable in an abandoned condemnation action. (orange county mun. water dist. v. anaheim union water co. (1967) 247 cal. app.2d 761, 764 [56 cal. rptr. 464].) (10c) here, however, the trial court correctly determined that part of the costs alleged, i.e., delay damages, were improper. logically

19	 or requested the information from a person that the peace officer has good cause to believe is a witness to a criminal offense. tex. penal code ann. § 38.02(a)-(b) (west 2011). we agree with the houston court that the offense of failure to identify by intentionally giving a false or fictitious name to a peace officer is an offense involving moral turpitude. see lape v. state, 893 s.w.2d 949, 958 (tex. app.—houston [14th dist.] 1994, pet. ref'd). but we also agree with the austin court that the offense of failure to identify by refusing to give the requested lester v. state page 2 information to a peace officer is not a crime of moral turpitude. see jones v. state, no. 03-04-00428-cr, 2005 tex. app. lexis 8720, 10-13 (tex. app.—austin oct. 20, 2005, pet. ref’d) (not designated for publication). outside the jury's presence, lester's counsel informed the trial court that he believed shoaf had a conviction for failure to identify for which she had served or was currently serving jail time. but counsel did not provide the trial court with anything that showed shoaf’s conviction was pursuant to section 38.02(b), which involves lying to a peace officer. see tex. penal code ann. § 38.02(b) (west 2011). accordingly, lester failed to meet his burden of proving that shoaf’s conviction for failure to identify was a crime of moral turpitude. see vinson v. state, 252 s.w.3d 336, 340 (tex. crim. app. 2008) (“in our criminal justice system, the proponent of evidence ordinarily has the burden of establishing the admissibility of the proffered evidence.”). thus, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence of shoaf's conviction for failure to identify. lester’s sole issue is overruled. having overruled the only issue raised on appeal, we affirm the trial court’s judgment. tom gray chief justice before chief justice gray, justice davis, and justice scoggins affirmed opinion delivered and filed july 13, 2011 publish [cr25] lester v. state page 3

23	the prognostic and predictive role of pain before systemic chemotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer: an individual participant data meta-analysis of the north-eastern german society of gynecological oncology (noggo) of 1226 patients. aim of this study was to analyze the impact of pain on quality of life and survival in recurrent oc patients. raw data including the qlq-c30 questionnaire from three phase ii/iii trials ("topotecan phase iii," "hector," and "trias") conducted by the north-eastern german society of gynecological oncology (noggo) were synthesized and analyzed using logistic and cox regression analyses. data on pain was available for 952 patients out of 1226. moderate to severe pain, which was defined as pain ≥ 50 in the qlq-c30 symptom scale, was experienced by more than one-third of patients (36.6%). a total of 31% were taking non-opioid pain medication and 16% opioids. median age at randomization was 61 years (range 25-84). most patients (84.7%) were diagnosed in figo iii/iv. pain was independent from age, figo stage, grading, amount of recurrences, and chemotherapy-free interval. ecog was significantly worse in patients with pain (p < 0.001). fatigue, nausea/vomiting, sleeping disorders, and abdominal symptoms such as loss of appetite, diarrhea, and constipation were more frequently found in patients with pain (all p < 0.001). quality of life was significantly diminished (p < 0.001). pain was also an independent marker for overall survival (os). median os was 18.2 months in patients with pain compared with 22.0 months in patients without pain (p = 0.013, hr 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.48). os was shorter in patients with pain and without pain medication compared with those on sufficient pain medication, whereas os was mostly decreased in patients having pain despite pain medication (18.5, 19.6, and 15.0 months respectively; p = 0.026). progression-free survival and prior treatment discontinuation were not associated with pain. best supportive care including sufficient pain medication should be delivered as early as possible because effective pain management is crucial for both quality of life and overall survival in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

25	 the bobbin of the linear motor is positioned symmetrically with respect to the center of gravity of the optical head with the first guide shaft as an axis of symmetry and connected to the optical head. therefore, a couple of forces are generated at a thrust acting point of the linear motor and the center of gravity of the optical head to generate torsional and abrasive forces between the bearings and the guide shafts. due to this, service lives of the bearings will be shortened. in addition, balance between a load applied to the circular bearing and a load applied to the elliptic bearing may be lost such that the load on the elliptic bearing is excessively reduced to vibrate a driving system. due to this, a driving action may not be stable.
26	a lysine-rich arabinogalactan protein in arabidopsis is essential for plant growth and development, including cell division and expansion. arabinogalactan proteins (agps), a family of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, occur throughout the plant kingdom. the lysine-rich classical agp subfamily in arabidopsis consists of three members, atagp17, 18 and 19. in this study, atagp19 was examined in terms of its gene expression pattern and function. atagp19 mrna was abundant in stems, with moderate levels in flowers and roots and low levels in leaves. atagp19 promoter-controlled gus activity was high in the vasculature of leaves, roots, stems and flowers, as well as styles and siliques. a null t-dna knockout mutant of atagp19 was obtained and compared to wild-type (wt) plants. the atagp19 mutant had: (i) smaller, rounder and flatter rosette leaves, (ii) lighter-green leaves containing less chlorophyll, (iii) delayed growth, (iv) shorter hypocotyls and inflorescence stems, and (v) fewer siliques and less seed production. several abnormalities in cell size, number, shape and packing were also observed in the mutant. complementation of this pleiotropic mutant with the wt atagp19 gene restored the wt phenotypes and confirmed that atagp19 functions in various aspects of plant growth and development, including cell division and expansion, leaf development and reproduction.

31	 at no point did the journalist who wrote the original ign piece ask me for my side of the story. so here it is: i started at team bondi on april 5, 2004, as a junior programmer straight out of university. during my final year at university brendan mcnamara gave a talk about a game he wanted to make and how he was starting a new studio in sydney to make it. this was a dream come true! i'd been hoping that by the time i finished my degree i'd have the opportunity to make games right here in my home town, and sure enough here it was. i'd emailed brendan within an hour or so of the end of his talk and two interviews later i had the job! from there i made my way to programmer, senior programmer, and finally to my current position. during the early years of l.a. noire, we generally worked 9 to 6. occasionally we'd do some late nights towards the end of a milestone, but by and large it was pretty smooth sailing. unfortunately as time went on we failed to make as much progress as we'd have liked and there was growing pressure to work longer hours. it was not any one person's fault that we weren't making progress, responsibility for that has to rest with the entire team. there were times when it seemed too hard to keep on going. work kept piling up, potential release dates slipped by, and frustration grew. at these times we lost people, who legitimately decided that they weren't willing to keep on pushing. recognising that working on the weekend was inevitable, team bondi put in place a scheme to (generously) reward employees for their weekend days spent at work. additionally, in the last 6 months of the project a scheme was put in place to reward employees for staying back late on weeknights, and this resulted in myself and most of my team getting an additional 4 weeks of leave upon completion of l.a. noire, on top of the weekend working payment. towards the end of the project i was probably working (on average) around 65 hours per week.

33	us told pakistan to get out of occupied areas during kargil war 'us told pakistan to get out of areas occupied during kargil war': ex-pakistan envoy islamabad:-"india is hopping mad. please get out of the places you have occupied,"was the american message to pakistan in the wake of the kargil war in 1999, the country's then envoy to the us, riaz khokhar said today. almost 15 years after pakistani troops intruded across the line of control sparking the border conflict, the issue came up for discussion at the islamabad literature festival. the speakers at the discussion, including former pakistani foreign secretaries khokhar and tariq osman hyder, and journalist nasim zehra had an open and frank talk about different aspects of the conflict. all the three speakers agreed that the war was an"avoidable venture". mr khokhar gave an insight into the american reaction to the kargil conflict. "it was an avoidable venture. i was called by senior (us) department of state officials and told to get out of the areas that we had occupied,"he said. he said the biggest failure of pakistan was that it was not able to develop a credible narrative."i think we were seen as an irresponsible country,"he said. mr khokhar said there was unanimity in the army that the then prime minister nawaz sharif was properly briefed on the war. he dismissed the notion that the theatre of war would have expanded had pakistan not withdrawn. "the us said india is hopping mad. please get out of the areas you have occupied otherwise the theatre of war might expand. it was a mere threat that us used,"he said. mr khokhar said there was no movement of troops on the indian side to suggest that the theatre of war would spread. ms zehra said,"kargil is not something that pakistan army as an institution is proud of". she said there was a"kargil clique"of"four generals who had planned it which was more or less a disaster". pakistani soldiers needed better leadership than those who planned the kargil conflict, she said. according to my theory, all pakistan's lies and denials are exposed by high ranking pakistanis, in a decade's time (10 yrs). so, by that count, it's 5 yrs late. but
34	 and order the plaintiffs to specifically perform their obligations under the contract. a judgment will be entered in accordance with this opinion. notes [1] the non-occurrence of a condition precedent relieves the party, in whose favor the condition worked, from further performance. 5 s. williston, a treatise on the law of contracts § 665 (3d ed. 1961). thus, if this court were to accept the government's argument that the delivery of the deed by the government and the furnishing of financial information by the plaintiffs were both condition precedents that did not occur, both parties would be excused from future performance. id. this would basically serve to rescind the contract, a result sought by the plaintiffs, not the government. the government's brief seems to realize this problem and attempts to avoid this result by arguing that there are "extenuating circumstances" in this case. (see d.i. 17 at 14.) the result could also be avoided if the court found that the plaintiffs' failure to provide adequate financial information served to excuse the condition that the government deliver the deed within the thirty-day limit. see 5 s. williston, supra, § 676. however, due to the court's decision that the government's delivery of the deed within thirty days is not a condition precedent, the court need not consider either of these arguments. [2] the record indicates that the government delivered the executed quitclaim deed to the plaintiffs before receiving the executed note and security instruments. (see d.i. 9 at ¶ 5; 7 at ex. e.) this is in conflict with the language of section iv of the contract quoted in the text. neither parties' brief explains why this occurred. however, in determining if a contract provision is a condition precedent, this court must base its findings on the language of the contract and the parties' manifestations of their intentions at the time of the execution of the contract. see 5. s. williston, supra note 1, § 663. thus, the parties' actions at the time of delivery are irrelevant for our purposes.

39	most of the victims involved in the 103 cases were inebriated or had a few drinks, at least, which is why cnn put a spotlight on how uber markets itself as a safe way to go home in its report. the ride-hailing giant aired ads that show women taking an uber for nights out. it even teamed up with mothers against drunk driving to launch a designated driver campaign urging women to take an uber instead of driving under the influence. while 18 of the 103 cases have already been dropped or dismissed, it didn't include data on complaints that couldn't be verified with incident reports. and considering cnn was only able to look into 20 states' documents, that means uber is likely dealing with a lot more than 103 cases. an uber spokesperson told engadget that it has recently beefed up its safety approach by introducing an emergency button and a safety feature that lets you designate contacts to share trips with in its app. uber will also start rerunning driver background checks on an annual basis and will keep an eye out for new criminal cases filed against its drivers. "these stories are horrific and our hearts go out to the victims. we worked with cnn to understand their findings and determined that uber did 2.4 billion trips in the u.s. in that same period. but even one incident on our platform is too many which is why safety is uber's top priority for 2018 and beyond. we recently strengthened our safety approach with new features including an emergency button, driver screening improvements, and the addition of the former secretary of homeland security to head up uber's safety advisory board. this is just a start and we are committed to doing even more." uber isn't the only ride-hailing firm facing these issues, though: cnn also found 18 cases accusing lyft drivers of sexual assault over the past four years.
40	idaho pilot found on island paramedics with an air ambulance service rescued friday night an idaho pilot who had been stranded on fremont island in the great salt lake for nearly nine hours. dallen ward, 31, almo, idaho, was rescued from the island at about 9 p.m. and was uninjured, said tim hines, a paramedic with airmed. "he had a signal fire set on the beach to alert us."hines said if it weren't for the fire ward had built, they would have had a hard time finding him in the darkness. ward apparently didn't have a radio. ward's business partner notified the weber county sheriff's office of the missing pilot about 6 p.m. an airmed crew flew to the island after it was notified. hines said the pilot damaged his plane when he landed on the island about 12:30 p.m. friday and was unable to get it going again. the impact of the landing "bent the prop and severed the oil line," the paramedic said. the pilot found shelter in an old sheep camp on the island and waited there for someone to notice the signal fire and come and get him, hines said.
41	sweet charity tony award party will benefit the theatre artist fund of greater richmond. phil whiteway of barksdale/theatre iv (left) and richmond triangle players' philip crosby are two of the administrators behind an emergency fund for area theater professionals. a special tony award viewing party is being held this week, with proceeds going to the fund. the idea came at intermission. "i just love the tony awards and wanted to throw a party," says keith martin, the former managing director of the richmond ballet, about the initial idea of an emergency fund for people in the local theater community. and so martin and other local performing arts folks will hold a tony awards viewing party at the richmond triangle players building june 12. not only that — they'll also use the event to raise money for the theatre artist fund of greater richmond. the fund, which gives help to those in the theater community that have fallen upon sudden dire straits, came out of a repeated need. one person, dying of aids, was about to be evicted from his apartment and become homeless. before the fund even existed, the theater community raised money to pay for an apartment until he passed on. another time, a man who'd just undergone major life-saving surgery was returning home for eight weeks of bed recovery. in the dead of winter and without funds to fix his broken furnace, the theater community again rallied to purchase the man a new heater. the fund has only been used a handful of times since its official creation in 2006, martin says, and all the recipients were fully employed and insured before tragic events unfolded in their lives. "it's [for] that kind of catastrophic event where someone needs help immediately," martin says. "all of us are only one disaster away from financial devastation." the idea was taken up by a coalition of actors and artists, and was established through the community foundation with the assistance of the richmond alliance of professional theatres and companies such as theatre iv. all contributions to the fund are tax deductible. phil whiteway, the managing director of barksdale/theatre iv, helped to establish the fund, and serves on the board that assesses who is awarded money.

45	 the analyses demonstrate that thenew mesoscopic model reproduces experimental results better than itspredecessors, which modeled histone tails as rigid entities. inparticular, our model with flexible histone tails: correctly accounts forsalt-dependent conformational changes in the histone tails; yields theexperimentally obtained values of histone-tail mediated core/coreattraction energies; and considers the partial shielding of electrostaticrepulsion between dna linkers as a result of the spatial distribution ofhistone tails. these effects are crucial for regulating chromatinstructure but are absent or improperly treated in models with rigidhistone tails. the development of this model of oligonucleosomes thusopens new avenues for studying the role of histone tails and theirvariants in mediating gene expression through modulation of chromatinstructure. although numerous experiments indicate that the chromatin fiber displayssalt-dependent conformations, the associated molecular mechanism remainsunclear. here, we apply an irregular discrete surface charge optimization(disco) model of the nucleosome with all histone tails incorporated todescribe by monte carlo simulations salt-dependent rearrangements of anucleosomal array with 12 nucleosomes. the ensemble of nucleosomal arrayconformations display salt-dependent condensation in good agreement withhydrodynamic measurements and suggest that the array adopts highlyirregular 3d zig-zag conformations at high (physiological) saltconcentrations and transitions into the extended "beads-on-a-string"conformation at low salt. energy analyses indicate that the repulsionamong linker dna leads to this extended form, whereas internucleosomeattraction drives the folding at high salt. the balance between these twocontributions determines the salt-dependent condensation. importantly, theinternucleosome and linker dna-nucleosome attractions require histonetails; we find that the h3 tails, in particular, are crucial forstabilizing the moderately folded fiber at physiological monovalent salt. structure of the conserved core of the yeast dot1p, a nucleosomal histoneh3 lysine 79 methyltransferase. j biol chem. 2004; 279: 43296-306 display abstract methylation of lys79 on histone h3 by dot1p is important for genesilencing. the elongated structure of the conserved core of yeast dot1pcontains an n-terminal helical domain and a seven-stranded catalyticdomain that harbors the binding site for the methyl-donor and an activesite pocket sided with conserved hydrophobic residues. thes-adenosyl-l-homocysteine exhibits an extended conformation distinct fromthe folded conformation observed in structures of set domain histonelysine methyltransferases. a catalytic asparagine (asn479), located at thebottom of the active site pocket, suggests a mechanism similar to thatemployed for amino methylation in dna and protein glutamine methylation.the acidic

47	 we note that the effectiveness of a court on review is seriously impaired where the hearing officer fails to make clearly distinguishable those findings which are based on the credibility of witnesses and those findings which are conclusions based on application of the law to subsidiary findings. the hearing officer's role in the legal process is an important one, and the drafting of findings must be undertaken with care and precision. in response to the commission's suggestion in its brief that "[t]he hearings officer's report indicates that she erroneously believed that the appointing authority was required to present two witnesses as to any charge which the employee denied," we note that such corroboration is not required. however, we need not reach the question whether her report reflects this erroneous belief in light of our disposition of this matter.

48	1. field of the invention the present invention relates to a video tape editing apparatus, and in particular, to a video tape editing apparatus which performs a signal insertion editing operation on a video tape on which audio signals are recorded on the same track(s) together with video signals in accordance with a helical scanning system. 2. description of the prior art for the insertion editing operation for recording new video signals, with audio signals if necessary, on a portion of video tape on which signals have already been recorded, it is necessary to record new video signals with proper matching established with respect to the track(s), on which video signals are already recorded, in order to not disturb the synchronization for regenerating the video signals. in a video tape recorder adopting a conventional system in which audio signals are recorded on a track different from a video track, a full-erase head need not be utilized for the insertion of new video signals and consequently, only video signals previously recorded on the video track can be replaced with, or overwritten by, new video signals by a video head while retaining the audio signals recorded on the audio track. however, in a system in which audio and video tracking signals are recorded on a video track, for example, by superimposing these signals with video signals, the audio signals previously recorded on the track will be erased if the new video signals are recorded on the track. for a motion picture playback operation, it may be often required to insert necessary related images, such as an explanation about an image and a title thereof, into a recorded scene. since such related images are closely associated with the environment of the recorded scene, a sudden interruption of the voice and sound due to the insertion, which have been continuously reproduced while playing back the recorded signals, would be disconcerting to the viewer. even if another audio sound is inserted after the interruption of the audio signals due to the insert operation, an unnatural impression cannot be suppressed. therefore, if other audio sound should be inserted, it is required for the insertion to retain the voice and sound previously recorded as much as possible, for example
49	 detect when an asynchronous exception has occurred, record the asynchronous exception, continue execution until a gar point is reached, and transfer control to the asynchronous exception handler for servicing the asynchronous event when the gar point is reached. these gar points correspond to instructions embedded in the translated code which correspond to locations in the instruction flow where state can be recovered. in addition, the gar points often include instructions which cause the dynamic translation system to check to determine whether an asynchronous event has occurred. for example, the buzbee patent discloses "transfer of control operations", which are instructions located at gar points that cause the predicate register to be checked to determine whether the flag is set. control is only transferred to the asynchronous signal handler if this flag is set, which is only set if an asynchronous signal has occurred. one of the problems associated with the prior approaches is that it is difficult for the processor executing the translated instructions to recognize when a gar point has been reached and immediately halt execution of instructions. furthermore, overhead is consumed at gar points in determining whether an asynchronous exception has occurred. for example, the buzbee patent refers to each block of translated code including a transfer of control operation. when the transfer of control operation is executed, a check is made to determine whether an asynchronous exception has occurred by checking the predicate register to determine whether the flag in the register has been set. if it has been set, control is transferred to the asynchronous signal handler. therefore, this check is made even when an asynchronous signal has not occurred. accordingly, a need exists for a method and apparatus for handling asynchronous exceptions in a dynamic translation system which minimizes the overhead required for handling such events and which are flexible in terms of hardware needed for implementation.

51	 a near identical number to a broader question about support for legalization asked in a washington post poll in january. together, the polls confirm a complete reversal of opinions among african americans from four years ago. then, 37 percent were in favor of legalization and 55 percent opposed. the district’s rapidly changing demographics also help explain the possible success of the initiative. in four years, the population in the district has swelled by 45,000, or 7.4 percent, and many newcomers are young, white and increasingly affluent. more than 7 in 10 voters in these groups support legalization. all that puts the district far to the left of the legalization discussion nationally with the country closely divided at 49 percent in favor and 48 percent opposed, according to a washington post-abc news poll earlier this year. nina moiseiwitsch, 19, a college student studying biomedical engineering in new york, said she is certain to vote absentee in the district to be heard on the marijuana issue. the government and police “have better things to focus on than trying to keep on top of something they really can’t,” she said. “i think it’s a distraction from . . . harder drugs that really are a problem in d.c. and it could become safer once regulated.” activists collected more than 57,000 signatures to qualify the measure for the ballot. they pushed forward even as some pro-marijuana groups urged restraint, concerned legalization in the district risks forcing congress to react. as it is, votes will be held in the district, alaska and oregon to decide legalization in november. alaskans voted down a similar measure a decade ago but also have no criminal or monetary fines for possession. the measure in oregon led by a bare majority in a poll five months ago. voters in florida also appear certain to approve a medical marijuana measure in november. the measure would allow people 21 and older to possess as much as two ounces of marijuana for personal use and to grow up to three marijuana plants at home. to keep from triggering a prohibition on ballot measures that run afoul of federal law, initiative 71 does not spell out that the district would allow for the sale of marijuana.
52	 he and his codefendant discussed many options to kill the victim, including poisoning. they eventually decided to write a personal ad that they believed the victim would respond to. it was under this pretense that they were able to isolate the victim in the parking lot and murder him. his behavior continued inside the institution, where he readily admitted to placing contraband in other cells in order to force other inmates out of his living situation. these are some examples of the type of behavior that mr. wilborn has engaged in that causes the members of the parole board to question whether he can be trusted in the community. parole involves a great deal of trust in the community that a person will live and act as a law-abiding citizen. the board is of the opinion that mr. wilborn will say or do anything in order to be released on parole supervision. his credibility, honesty, and ability to be trusted in the community are at the heart of this decision. (dec. at 2) (emphasis added). factual disputes wilborn takes exception to the parole board's description of the two events (in addition to the murder itself) on which the board relied in support of its conclusion that wilborn has engaged in "extremely manipulative and deceptive behavior." (id.; compl. at ¶ 52). according to wilborn, prior to his 1983 guilty plea wilborn's criminal record was limited to a 1981 misdemeanor charge to which he pleaded guilty when he was an 18-year-old high school student. (compl. at ¶ 56). this is the "sneaking into a home" incident on which the board relied. contrary to the board's conclusion that wilborn could offer "no credible explanation for his actions," wilborn contends that he fully answered each of the questions posed by the board and provided the board "with as accurate [an] explanation as he could of the facts and circumstances surrounding the twenty-five year old charge." (id. at ¶ 57). wilborn contends that the board's purported reliance on this event is a subterfuge, and he questions "why a 25-year-old misdemeanor was relevant in 2006 to the issue of `trust'" and "what the 1981 incident had to do with mr. wilborn's rehabilitation or likelihood of recidivism in 2006."

"third-quarter adjusted operating income for the dsd dairy segment is 21% higher than the very difficult third quarter of last year while fluid milk volumes were over 3% higher this quarter than the third quarter of 2007. "at whitewave-morningstar, sales continue to grow at a strong pace, while profitability was challenged in the quarter by increasing commodity costs at morningstar and the continued effects of higher organic milk costs on whitewave’s horizon organic brand. overall, it was a very encouraging quarter and positions us well to finish out the year strong." operating income of dsd dairy was $140,444,000 in the third quarter, up from $116,543,000. net sales of the dsd dairy business were $2,523,357,000, up 1% from $2,498,634,000 in the same period last year. higher volumes were partly offset by the effects of lower overall dairy commodity costs. the lower costs were a significant contributor to higher operating profits for the division as were increased proceeds from excess cream sales and cost control efforts. energy costs and packaging costs were countervailing forces. "dsd dairy fluid milk volumes outpaced the overall market, increasing 3.2% over year-ago levels, including a significant contribution from our acquisitions this year," mr
55	months after natural gas explosions and fires level homes in the boston suburbs and left thousands without heat or water, families throughout the region are still struggling for thanksgiving. more than 2,000 homes are still without gas service in lawrence, north andover and andover after gas lines were overpressurized during an otherwise routine pipeline replacement project and triggered dozens of explosions and fires on sept 13. one person was killed, dozens were injured and over 100 structures were damaged or destroyed in the blasts. "it's hard because i don’t have anything to cook for my kids," hilda delgado told boston 25 news. "i'm stressing. for cook, we got nothing. no stove for tomorrow. it's hard, we have no dinner for tomorrow." more than 1,500 people are spending the holiday in hotels, apartments, and trailers paid for by columbia gas. the utility is responsible for the sept. 13 fires that killed one, injured dozens and destroyed or damaged more than 100 structures. while some residents have chosen to tough it out in chilly homes, more than 1,500 families are spending the holiday in hotels, apartments and trailers paid for by columbia gas.

"i'm stressing. for cook, we got nothing. no stove for tomorrow. it's hard, we have no dinner for tomorrow." residents allowed to return home following massachusetts gas explosions, governor says at a trailer park set up on lawrence's south common, jose grullon told the associated press that his family's holiday would be more subdued than usual. the 45-year-old, his pregnant wife and two young children moved into a trailer last month after it became too cold in their apartment. like most affected homes, theirs didn't suffer any fires or explosions, but the hot water heater, boiler and other gas appliances were compromised by the overpressurization and need to be replaced before gas service can be restored. grullon said the family's trailer is simply too small to host the festive party he normally throws for family and friends, with food from his native dominican republic, dancing and music.
56	 most of the locking-based nonoccurrence control algorithms are strict in that they hold on to their locks until the end of the transaction. in distributed dobbs, the challenge is to extend both the serviceability argument and the concurrency control algorithms to the distributed execution environment. in these systems, the operations of a given transaction may execute at multiple sites where they access data. in such a case, the serviceability argument is more difficult to specify and enforce. the complication is due to the fact that the serialization order of the same set of transactions may be different at different sites. therefore, the execution of a set of distributed transactions is serialize if and only if 1 . the execution of the set of transactions at each site is serialize, and 2. the serialization orders of these transactions at all these sites are identical. distributed concurrency control algorithms enforce this notion of global serviceability. in locking- centralized locking, primary copy locking, and distributed locking algorithm. in centralized locking, there is a single lock table for the entire distributed database. this lock table is placed, at one of the sites, under the control of a single lock manager. the lock manager is responsible 7 for setting and releasing locks on behalf of transactions. since all locks are managed at one site, this is similar to centralized concurrency control and it is straightforward to enforce the global serviceability rule. these algorithms are simple to implement, but suffer from two problems. the central site may become a bottleneck, both because of the amount of work it is expected to perform and because of the traffic that is generated around it; and the system may be less reliable since the failure or inaccessibility of the central site would cause system unavailability. primary copy locking is a concurrency control algorithm that is useful in replicated databases where there may be multiple copies of a data item stored at different sites. one of the copies is designated as a primary copy and it is this copy that has to be locked in order to access that item. the set of primary copies for each data item is known to all the sites in the distributed system, and the lock requests on behalf of transactions are directed to the appropriate primary copy.
57	may 20 schlock value: the hearse (1980) this week, we’re finally breaking into the 1980s, but only just barely. released in the spring of 1980, the hearse was looking to cash in on the 1970s’ “devil craze” and it draws plenty of inspiration from such films as the amityville horror, the omen, and rosemary’s baby, but unfortunately, the subgenre was pretty tired by this point, and it was just too little, too late. helmed by editor-turned-director george bowers, and starring trish van devere (who had just appeared alongside her husband george c. scott earlier that year in the brilliant the changeling) and the legendary joseph cotten (citizen kane, shadow of a doubt, soylent green), the hearse tells the story of a young woman, who has just gone trough a painful divorce, moves out to the country to live in a house that belonged to her late aunt (who may or may not have been a witch), seeking a hard reset on her life. what was meant to be a relaxing getaway turns into a nightmare as all sorts of weird things begin to happen. it’s a little bit of a witch movie and a little bit of a haunted house movie, but more importantly, is it a scary movie? not particularly. the film begins in san francisco as jane hardy (van devere) is about to head out to her aunt’s house. after a few goodbyes and a final meeting with her therapist, she hits the road. before long, it’s nighttime, and as jane approaches the town of blackford, she is sideswiped by an old black hearse which immediately takes off down the road. a little shaken, jane arrives in blackford, and calls up walter prichard (cotten), a grouchy old attorney (and caretaker of the house?), who is none too pleased to be called so late at night. once she gets into the house, she begins to settle in and it’s not long before strange things begin happening. throughout the film, all of the cliches are present: a music box begins playing on its own, a door slams shut, windows break, jane’s spectral aunt appears in mirrors, a big black hearse appears outside. each night in the house, it’s something else.
58	 think of aura as “cool.” what is cool? how easy is it to be cool? and who decides just what cool is? to illustrate the broader idea, consider contemporary debates about modern art, and the typical question: “you call that art?” this challenge summons a dispute about who can decide whether something has aura, the experts or the masses. or just think about the mona lisa. you’ve seen it all your life: leonardo da vinci’s depiction of a lone woman and her mysterious smile. you’ve seen it, right? you’ve been told that you have to see it. but have you seen it? have you journeyed to paris, traveled to the louvre, bought your tickets, stood in line, and peered past the crowd to see the supposed original mona lisa? that would be cool! that desire, and that privilege, is what benjamin means by aura. and, sure, he’d understand your reason to join the cult of da vinci purists. it’s cool to get past the rope, to be on the inside. to own the experience that others seek. but benjamin would add: there is power in reproduction beyond the pleasure of possession. there is value in the broader potential of exhibition enabled by the multitudes of copies accessible to the world’s population who cannot, or will not, journey to paris. that’s what benjamin means when he writes, “mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual.” this leads to the second big idea of this essay: benjamin’s comparison between collective sensibility and individual reflection. here, he advocates for mass media as a tool not just for entertainment but also for education – and advocacy. from this perspective we come to value the technologies of production – and want to understand them. those who would use media to change things would seek to demystify their inner workings, to remove the power of production from a rarified few… … to de-fetishize the auteur, just as they would denigrate the ritualized and ordered worship of inaccessible heroes. hmm… de-fetishizing the auteur. what does that mean? to answer that question from a contemporary perspective, think about the power of sampling in pop music

60	missoula – northwest montana is still at greater risk of a more severe fire season than other parts of the state because of drought, according to the latest wildland fire potential outlook report. the national interagency fire center says that with el nino conditions forecasted to persist through the summer months, western montana is expected to be warmer and wetter than average for the months of june, july, and august. as is the case all years, if dry thunderstorms become more prevalent, the odds of lightning-caused fires blowing up increase- a chance that’s even more prevalent in northwest montana. “the driest areas are in northwest montana, and we do see some enhanced potential there over the kootenai and flathead national forest,” explained northern rockies coordination center predictive services meteorologist michael redmond. “we do expect the fire potential to be above normal there, but the rest of western montana, we are still thinking it will still be the average type potential for july and august,” he added. northwest montana has seen below average precipitation since last summer. -meteorologist russ thomas
61	 among the parents caught up in the new rules is 29-year-old vilma aracely lopez juc de coc, who fled her home in a remote guatemalan village after her husband was beaten to death in february, according to advocates. when she reached the texas border with her 11-year-old son in may, he was taken from her by border agents, she said. her eyes swollen, she cried when she asked a paralegal what she most wanted to know: when could she see her son again? “she did not know what was going on,” said paralegal georgina guzman, recalling their conversation at a federal courthouse in mcallen, texas. similar scenarios play out on a daily basis in federal courtrooms in texas and arizona, where dozens of immigrant parents appear on charges of entering the country illegally after traveling up from central america. more than the legal outcome of their cases, their advocates say, they’re worried about their children. advertisement since trump’s inauguration, the administration has issued at least half a dozen orders and changes affecting immigrant children, many of them obscure revisions. the cumulative effect is a dramatic alteration of immigration policy and practice. the measures require a senior government official to sign off on the release of children from secure shelters and allow immigration enforcement agents access to information about sponsors who sign up to take the children out of government custody and care for them. the crackdown expanded in april, when the administration announced a “zero tolerance” policy on the border to prosecute immigrants for entering the country illegally in the hopes they could be quickly deported and that the swift deportations would prevent more people from coming. parents are now being arrested and placed in quick federal court proceedings near the border. since children cannot be jailed in federal prisons, they’re placed in shelters that have long existed for unaccompanied immigrant children arriving on the border alone. the administration insists the new rules are necessary to send a message to immigrants. “look, i hope that we don’t have to separate any more children from any more adults,” attorney general jeff sessions said last week. “but there’s only one way to ensure that is the case: it’s for people to stop smuggling children illegally. stop crossing the border illegally with your children.
62	as the drought bites deeper, residents in a growing number of rural communities are fighting to stop local groundwater being taken to satisfy australia's thirst for bottled water. at tamborine mountain in queensland's gold coast hinterland, some locals are angry that bore water supplies are being used to supply bottled water companies. "we watch the water tankers go up and down the road," local tanya bregnsdal said. she believes the bottled water industry is to blame for her bore running dry. water has been extracted from daylesford's famous mineral springs for more than a century, but even here residents are concerned about taking water for the bottling industry. ( abc: dale cochrane ) "it's supposed to be a lush, beautiful place and we're just desperate for the water tankers to stop," ms bregnsdal said. every week nearly one third of australians buy bottled water, and the industry generates more than $700 million revenue annually. dianne warnes is among the residents here who want the 'water mining' industry, as opponents call it, shut down. "the water that's being extracted is being taken to the plastic bottle factories and all it's doing is adding to the pollution and taking our water," she said. ms warnes said there needs to be proper monitoring and metering of groundwater in the area. "we need to have meters on bores and to make people accountable for the water that they're using," she said. tamborine resident dianne warnes is leading a local community group against the water bottling industry.

63	lincrna-uc002yug.2 involves in alternative splicing of runx1 and serves as a predictor for esophageal cancer and prognosis. long intergenic noncoding rnas (lincrnas) have critical regulatory roles in cancer biology; however, the contributions of lincrnas to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) have been infrequently explored. the aim of this study was to explore the contribution of lincrnas, located at escc susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies, to the risk and prognosis of escc. the associations between lincrnas and the risk and prognosis of escc were analyzed in 358 diagnosed patients from eastern china, and the findings were validated in 326 additional patients from southern china. functional relevance of lincrnas was further examined by biochemical assays. we found that lincrna-uc002yug.2 was commonly overexpressed in escc compared with paired peritumoral tissue in eastern and southern chinese populations. the expression levels of lincrna-uc002yug.2 in escc might be a prognostic factor for survival. moreover, lincrna-uc002yug.2 promoted a combination of runx1 and alternative splicing (as) factors in the nucleus to produce more runx1a, the short isoform and inhibitor of runx1, and reduce cebpα (ccaat/enhancer-binding protein-α) gene expression, thereby promoting escc progression. these results indicated that lincrna-uc002yug.2 might involve in as of runx1/aml1 and serve as a predictor for esophageal cancer and prognosis.

65	 re: old school analysis: the overmind really was trying to destroy the protoss well said sandy. the zerg seeking to replicate archons figured into my speculations for some time, but the zerg seeking a twilight archon as you suggest never occurred to me. edit: although the context of your explanation is an ad hoc rationalization for metzen's idiot plot. key events of sc1 contradict the manual for no apparent reason. i thought i went over that numerous times. edit: i always did wonder why the overmind didn't clone protoss or other species from the xel'naga records. the records might have been missing sufficient info to make them from scratch or been millions of years out of date, but you would expect the overmind to create sc2 swarm queens and hybrids using the old protoss data. re: old school analysis: the overmind really was trying to destroy the protoss while the sc1 campaign has the overmind saying they will become perfect once they assimilate the protoss, this misunderstands the manual since the protoss are only the strongest species in the milky way galaxy and not the entire universe. still disagree. it never says anywhere that he thinks becoming perfect will make him the strongest. he wants to both become perfect (after discovering xel'naga memories) and assimilate the strongest species (the original zerg motive). assimilating the protoss accomplishes both. he'll assimilate their purity of form and other strong traits they have. they're the gold standard, but of course he'll still come after other species like humanity to assimilate other strong or useful traits. in the purely literal sense, this will involve destroying the protoss: their armed forces must be crushed, any useful traits must be assimilated, and any survivors must be exterminated, with priority in that order. where is this order and priority list from? his goal is to assimilate them like it says in the manual but obviously he has to destroy their military to do so. re: old school analysis: the overmind really was trying to destroy the protoss originally posted by mislagnissa again, this is all a misunderstanding. the long-term goal of the overmind is to chase perfection (a conditional and indefinite goal) and the short-term goal is to survive the inevitable apocalyptic conflict with the protoss.
66	two-particle correlations in ppb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02tev are studied as a function of the pseudorapidity separation (δη) of the particle pair at small relative azimuthal angle (|δφ| < π/3). the correlations are decomposed into a jet component that dominates the short-range correlations (|δη| < 1), and a component that persists at large δη and may originate from collective behavior of the produced system. the events are classifie d in terms of the multiplicity of the produced particles. finite azimuthal anisotropies are observed in high-multiplicity events. the second and third fourier components of the particle-pair azimuthal correlations, v2 and v3, are extracted after subtraction of the jet component. the single-particle anisotropy parameters v2 and v3 are normalized by their laboratory frame midrapidity value and are studied as a function of ηc.m.. the normalized v2 distribution is found to be asymmetric about ηc.m.=0, with smaller values observed at forward pseudorapidity, corresponding to the direction of the proton beam, while no significant pseudorapidity dependence is observed for the normalized v3 distribution within the statistical uncertainties.

69	hunting knf officials must survey public for opinions and render decision to finalize aug. 17, 2011 -- the louisiana wildlife and fisheries commission (lwfc), in a special meeting to consider changing already established still hunting dates to allow for deer hunting with dogs in kisatchie national forest (knf), today approved a motion for a nine day period in december for that activity. knf officials at the meeting explained and answered questions regarding the us forest service process. “because the federal ban on deer hunting with dogs on kisatchie has been reversed, the commission felt the issue should be reconsidered in fairness to those hunters who choose to hunt deer with dogs,” said stephen sagrera, lwfc chairman. the dates approved by the commission, dec. 17 through 25, would pertain to the catahoula, winn and kisatchie ranger districts and the evangeline unit of the calcasieu ranger district. “the forest service will proceed with addressing those deficiencies identified in the previous process and will include opportunities for the public to comment and participate,” said michael balboni, knf forest supervisor. “the goal is to make a new decision this fall.” commission action, taken as a declaration of emergency, was necessary since the 2011-12 deer hunting dates recommended by the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries (ldwf) had been finalized following the public comment period provided from february through may of 2011. ldwf had not included deer hunting with dog dates as part of the proposed 2011-12 deer hunting season due to a decision announced by knf officials in the fall of 2010 that deer hunting with dogs would no longer be allowed on knf property. us forest service officials in washington, d.c., reversed the regional decision to discontinue deer hunting with dogs indicating that the rationale used to make that decision was not sound. that information was presented to the commission at their aug. 4 regular monthly meeting, prompting a reconsideration of the 2011-12 deer hunting dates already in place. if deer hunting with dogs on knf proceeds on the dates approved by the commission today, the permitting process for that activity, as established by ldwf in 2010, will again be required for all hunters during the dec. 17 – 25 portion of the deer season on knf.

73	 as in this case, the testimony at trial is conflicting, it is within the province of the jury to resolve the conflict. see mcgalliard v. kuhlmann, 722 s.w.2d 694, 697 (tex.1986). further, expert testimony on damages is only evidentiary and non-binding upon the trier of fact. novosad, 881 s.w.2d at 548. under a legal sufficiency standard, we review the evidence in the light most favorable the prevailing party and indulge every reasonable inference in favor of those findings to determine whether more than a scintilla of evidence supports the challenged findings. see associated indem. corp. v. cat contracting, 964 s.w.2d 276, 285-86 (tex.1998); formosa plastics corp. v. presidio eng'rs & contractors, inc., 960 s.w.2d 41, 48 (tex. 1998). here, the jury received conflicting testimony from physicians who treated martinez, reviewing medical experts, and vocational rehabilitation witnesses. in spite of gainsco's detailed recitation of martinez's pre-existing injuries, the jury chose to disbelieve gainsco's theory characterizing martinez as a malingerer. peterson v. reyna, 908 s.w.2d 472, 476 (tex. app.-san antonio 1995, writ granted) modified by 920 s.w.2d 288 (tex.1996). because evidence exists in the record to support the verdict, we decline to sit as a thirteenth juror and overturn the decision of the jury. see carr v. jaffe aircraft corp., 884 s.w.2d 797, 799, 802-03 (tex. app.-san antonio 1994, no writ). finally, gainsco claims the jury award was excessive. a claim that damages are excessive is reviewed under a factual sufficiency analysis. pope v. moore, 711 s.w.2d 622, 624 (tex.1986). in martinez's case, the broad-form question comprised four elements: physical pain and mental anguish, loss of earning capacity, physical impairment, and medical care. we examine all the evidence to determine whether the award is supported by the evidence and order a remittitur only if the award is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. id.
74	friday on the fox news channel while discussing the federal bureau of investigation’s reopening the investigation into democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton’s use of a private unsecured email server during her tenure as secretary of state, “fox news sunday” host chris wallace said there has to be a “substantial” reason. wallace said, “you have got to know that james comey did not want to reopen this investigation. a month ago, he was asked by a republican congressman on the house judiciary committee about all the information that had come up since he closed the investigation in july. ‘well, why don’t you reopen it?’ he said, ‘that doesn’t come even close to reopening the investigation.’ so for him to do that now, just 11 days before the election — and i promise you, he can read the calendar just like all the rest of us — this has to be substantial. not saying that it’s going to put it over the edge and result in a criminal case against hillary clinton. but this has to be substantial enough, and you know that he didn’t want to do this, that he had to, in effect, eat his words, go back to these committees, and announce this investigation — fully aware of the bombshell effect it was going to have on the final week and a half of this campaign.”
75	breaking down the mess we call the nfc east right now the worst division in all of football is the nfc east. there really isn't a great team. right now the cowboys are decent sitting at 3-3, the eagles tied with them at 3-3 as well. the redskins have not been very good this year, but if they clean up the special teams mistakes, that becomes a game. they have already been on their bye week and are 1-4. the lowly giants are 0-6 and just plummeting. they are coming off a loss to the bears, with eli manning throwing 3 picks, playing sloppy football. i think that this team is dysfunctional right now. i don't know why pick em' players continue to pick the giants considering they are heading for a top three draft pick. the other bad team in this division is the redskins. they have not played a complete game this year. some games they play good offense, but not good defense. some games they play good defense, but not good offense. this past game against the cowboys, it was the special teams that killed them. i think that a bright spot for the redskins is the mobility of rgiii. he looked like he was in pre-torn acl form, and is finally starting to look comfortable. an interesting thing that i noticed is that he sat out the preseason as a precaution. he missed four preseason games, the amount of games it has taken him to get back to his good form. i think if he doesn't miss preseason, he does ok by week one. the defense is still and issue and the redskins are a mediocre team right now. i think the eagles are on the outside looking in right now. i think that chip kelly would be making a huge coaching mistake if he didn't keep nick foles in. i think that he is the long term solution for the eagles and they need to realize that. i also think he might give them the best chance to win now. however, if they keep vick in, they might not do as well. they are coming off a good win against the buccaneer, and a good win to get their confidence up.

77	conventional latches are used to restrain the movement of one member or element with respect to another. for example, conventional door latches restrain the movement of a door with respect to a surrounding door frame. the function of such latches is to hold the door secure within the door frame until the latch is released and the door is free to open. existing latches typically have mechanical connections linking the latch to actuation elements such as handles which can be actuated by a user to release the latch. movement of the actuation elements is transferred through the mechanical connections and (if not locked) can cause the latch to release. the mechanical connections can be one or more rods, cables, or other suitable elements or devices. although the following discussion is with reference to door latches (e.g., especially for vehicle doors) for purposes of example and discussion only, the background information and the disclosure of the present invention provided applies equally to a wide variety of latches used in other applications. most current vehicle door latches contain a restraint mechanism for preventing the release of the latch without proper authorization. when in a locked state, the restraint mechanism blocks or impedes the mechanical connection between a user-operable handle (or other door opening device) and a latch release mechanism, thereby locking the door. many conventional door latches also have two or more lock states, such as unlocked, locked, child locked, and dead locked states. inputs to the latch for controlling the lock states of the latch can be mechanical, electrical, or parallel mechanical and electrical inputs. for example, by the turn of a user's key, a cylinder lock can mechanically move the restraint mechanism, thereby unlocking the latch. as another example, cable or rod elements connecting a door lock to the restraint mechanism can be controlled by one or more electrical power actuators. these actuators, sometimes called “power locks” can use electrical motors or solenoids as the force generator to change between locked and unlocked states. an important issue with regard to the design of latch assemblies is the desirability of a latch assembly to operate smoothly. unless friction is employed to retain one or more elements in desired positions in the latch assembly, low-friction contact (such as contact between rotatably-connected elements) is preferred

85	(physorg.com) -- the tiny, plant-like heterosigma akashiwo is too small to see with the naked eye, but the microscopic algae may pack a big environmental punch. university of delaware researchers are studying whether the species can neutralize harmful smokestack emissions  and also serve as a source of eco-friendly biofuel. the project is an outgrowth of biochemist kathryn coynes study into the ecology of h. akashiwo, which thrives in delaware and worldwide. coyne and her postdoctoral fellow, jennifer stewart, found that the algae contain a special enzyme with the unusual ability to detoxify nitric oxide, one of multiple contaminants released through industrial chimneys as flue gas. based on the discovery of that enzyme, coyne and stewart decided to explore the possibility of recruiting the algae for pollution control. they knew that other scientists were trying to use different types of algae to reduce emissions of another flue gas component, carbon dioxide, since algae need carbon dioxide to grow. the problem with those attempts was that the nitric oxide also present in flue gas usually killed the algae, said coyne, assistant professor of marine biosciences. its very harmful. thats where h. akashiwos special enzyme may come in handy. the protein may enable the algae to convert harmful nitric oxide into innocuous nitrate, while the algae are also metabolizing carbon dioxide. in addition to having pollution-fighting potential, h. akashiwo is a proven source of biofuel. rising petroleum prices and finite quantities of fossil fuels are prompting demand for renewable energy sources, and algae-derived biofuel is already powering some trains, jets and other machines. adding nitrogen is an important but costly step in the process of making biofuel. h. akashiwos ability to use nitric oxide from flue gas essentially eliminates that step. coynes project is still in the early stages, having only recently received funding from delaware sea grant. before investigating commercial applications, coyne will need to examine the long-term effects of flue gas on the algaes physiology. she will also evaluate how well h. akashiwo uses nitric oxide as a nitrogen source and how light intensities affect its production of the lipids and fatty acids used to make biofuel. yet the potential upsides could be great.
86	 that is because claimant's cited cases are uniformly distinguished by one important fact. each contains references to express time frames associated with the required filing of a notice of cancellation, unlike the missouri statute in question.[8] we also note the incongruity resulting in applying appellants' rationale to interpreting *905 the "renewal" provision of section 287.090.3 in interpreting the "cancellation" provision. presently the "renewal" of policy coverage takes effect in accordance with the terms of a policy. however, under appellants' rationale, a "renewal" would take effect only upon an insurance company's filing a notice of renewal. the insurance company alone could determine when insurance coverage would become effective simply by withholding notification to the division.[9] "it is presumed that in the enactment of laws the legislature does not intend to enact absurd laws." david ranken, jr. tech. inst. v. boykins, 816 s.w.2d 189, 192 (mo. banc 1991). lastly, in oral arguments appellants contended that in the absence of a specific statutory time frame within which an insurance company is required to file notice with the division, of either renewal or cancellation of a policy, this court should impose a "reasonable time" standard. the fallacy of this argument, however, is that this procedure would provide for a largely subjective test as to what would constitute a "reasonable time" within which an insurance company would be required to file notice of cancellation or renewal with the division. review by the courts of what may constitute a "reasonable time," would vary considerably, e.g., one, five, ten, thirty, fifty, sixty or more days, depending upon the particular facts and circumstances of each claim. we determine that this would make for a decidedly cumbersome procedure, one which simply does not comport with what we perceive to be the intent of the legislature from our plain reading of the statute. while we recognize that in our review a liberal construction of the act in favor of claimants is required, chambers, 948 s.w.2d at 450, this principle may not be extended so far as to negate what we believe to be the intent of the legislature. staples v. a.p.
87	 that this greek tragedy will end in catastrophe – yet another word of greece origin. if greece does not make the imf repayment due on 01 july 2015, it is quite possible that a political rabbit will be pulled out of the bag and default will be averted. angela merkel is apparently fond of the saying: where there is a will, there is a way. but based on the current situation, sooner rather than later, the country will run out of money. at that point, all hell will break loose, despite all the warm and comforting reassurances from politicians that firewalls are in place to avoid contagion that would wreak havoc across europe and possibly other parts of the world. having reflected on the last five months since the election of the greek government, i am tending to the conclusion that the greek drama may well end in a dénouement / catastrophe / catharsis resulting from the fine young radicals’ refusal to compromise. they will take the hit, re-establish the drachma or something similar and do their best to move forward. greece will then be fully in charge of its monetary policy, its currency, its dignity and everything else that its people, in an act of mass amnesia, believe germany and the other eurozone countries have taken away from them in the last five years. of course, they cannot then expect further eu bailouts, will have to live within their own financial means and will rely on their own politicians to navigate the process of regaining international competitiveness. hold on! for a second i almost forgot that this is precisely the scenario that the greek citizens have been bending over backwards and executing double somersaults to avoid. for otherwise they would surely have voted to exit the euro/eurozone/eu in one of their previous two general elections, rather than willingly go through the latest acts of this excruciating greek drama. perhaps it really is true that we cannot have it both ways… even in the eu.
88	 the fact is: most people that play games with a regularity different than for party purposes or the casual fun time usually prefer to sit down, taking the second set of controls. second is the space issue. motion gaming failed also because you had to create a space to be able to play. even i had trouble playing with a wii when i had to move the sofa and the living room table to be able to play. now, this may not seem to be an issue to play a game in vr, since for now it is only a visor, but i have already heard the discussion on how to make the game more real, many times portrayed with the treadmill base, as well as other extras that are not only space consuming, but also seemingly very expensive, no matter how much you mass produce it. even this little joke by college humor shows how problematic can an apparatus as complicated as the projected vr future be (not safe for work!). not only that, it will require much more movement than before. i can not imagine a person preparing himself half an hour to be connected to the apparatus to enjoy a game, especially after a hard day of work. this would be too complicated and not only obese people would suffer it, but also people on the wheelchair and with other kind of capacity problems. this makes gaming thus less playable, or at least less practical form even more public. the we have to take into account the labels. have you seen the labels on a 3ds box? here, let me quote it: warning viewing of 3d images by children 6 and under may cause vision damage. now, i am trying to be an alarmist, but the fact that we have such a label already tells us that the perception of a developing mind is actually affected by the staring at the 3d screens. i can’t imagine what perception issues the vr visor could cause to children, something that remains to be seen. i really hope for it to be harmless, no more than the occasional epilepsy thing, but then again, this new, untested ground. i see vr as a reality, but not as a game.

90	 but it has a bunch more (functions!) besides. the way it works is that you launch a command-line script that watches for changes in your .scss file (the file that you edit). when it changes, it compiles a .css file. it happened so quickly that i never noticed the compile time. javascript though the sites have some javascript, none of it is used to make the sites work at different screen sizes. i didn’t think it would be necessary, and it turned out i was right. (using javascript for this would make the sites harder to maintain, i reasoned.) testing testing on my desktop was easy: i used safari, chrome, and firefox. i also then uploaded the sites to a staging server and tested with ie 9 on vista and chromium on ubuntu (via vmware) and tested with an ipad and an iphone. other folks in the company tested with other browsers and with android devices. but testing was absolutely necessary. though adoption of css3 has progressed, this is not quite standards-based eden. version control i created a local mercurial repository whenever i started a project. i have not yet taken this all the way. i should have a repository that other folks at the company can access, and i should have a deploy script for staging and live servers. this is made somewhat complicated by the blogs: they’re wordpress blogs, and i don’t know if changing a theme is scriptable. (maybe it is. i haven’t looked yet.) what have i not learned? i’ve dipped my toes in: i’m a novice. at this point in learning new technology i try to get a rough idea of the size and shape of everything i haven’t learned yet. i also assume that i’ll look back to now and smack my forehead. but there’s an important thing i did learn: i learned that this work is fun. i was reminded of how the cocoa world felt in 2002 — those days felt like early days again. there was so much excitement for what we could make and what would come next. running a search at google was starting to feel like walking through a minefield. i’ve trained myself to be careful where i click
91	 jason has spent so much time with me in that way- talking to me and letting my cry and get things off my chest. i really don’t think i can repay him for all of the life changes that he has talked me through or allowed me to realize. i constantly go through these feelings of not being accepted, not being a part of what i so badly want to be. i always think that people don’t want me around- or that they don’t like me. this has stopped me from reaching out to people- and let me tell you, asking for help or human connection is one of the hardest things to do. putting yourself out there exposed and vulnerable sucks, right? yes it does- but if i have learned one thing, it’s part of the human condition- everyone has at one point or another felt the same exact way. we are not always willing to be honest with ourselves or others when it comes to this.. we always want to put up this front that we are super strong, nothing can touch or hurt us, we are independent... but the fact is that we all crave human connections. we have been making connections from the moment we were born- each and every single person that we have met in this life has had something to share or impart into our lives. even the negative interactions have taught us something. every path in my life that led me to meet the yogaslackers- all of my struggles of teaching yoga, the feeling of just giving up, and the last urge to follow this yogic path- were intensely challenging. looking back on them now, i know that it was all for a greater purpose. i met these amazing people and with that i ended up learning so much, not just because of them- but really they were the vehicle which helped me to attain a higher self. they nurtured and consoled me and they continue to be an amazing support... to them i will be forever grateful for pushing me to really look inside of myself to realize and see what is already there. let us make a conscious effort to find what already lies within us, because that person is amazing.
92	based in norco, calif., cani- dae pet food co. was born in 1996 with simple, healthful recipes. while its product line has expanded, its mission to provide high-quality diets to dogs and cats remains the same. pet product news: you and gordon were inspired to start canidae because you felt that a lot of pet food companies did not pay attention to consumers’ and retailers’ desires. what was it that you sought to do differently? scott whipple: twenty years ago, the pet food industry was in an entirely different marketplace. we saw independent retailers struggling to survive, so we made it our goal to help them as much as possible. we realized that in order for independent retail stores to continue attracting and satisfying new and loyal customers, they had to offer unique, standout products. this is where canidae came in to play. with our simple, healthful pet food recipes, we knew that consumers wanting to feed their family members a better product would seek out only the best options, which happened to be at their local, independent retailers. ppn: starting a pet food company is an enormous undertaking. how did you go about it? sw:we took one step at a time and ended up with a fantastic product that we are still proud of to this day. from the beginning, we knew the type of food that consumers wanted to give their pets, so we took the time to meet with nutritionists in order to determine how best to create a complete, balanced diet. from there, we created our first recipe and sat down with manufacturing companies to determine who could fulfill our specific needs and supply us with the pet food product of our dreams. after producing the first fewbatches of canidae, we gatheredinitial feedback from our breederand kennel contacts to determineif any adjustments needed to bemade before the food hit retailshelves. after minor changes, webegan the packaging process andliterally went door to door sellingcanidae to independent retailers. since we created a genuinely amazing product, we were able to gain distribution rather quickly throughout southern california, which then grew to other markets around the country. sw: canidae’s main differentiator continues to be our consumers.
93	main navigation the propaganda game an intimate look inside the world’s most locked down and satirised nation, the propaganda game serves as an interesting portrait of the way in which north korea wishes to be viewed in a contemporary context, directed by a man wishing to unravel their myths at the seams. alvaro longoria, after many failed attempts to gain access to the country, befriends north korea’s only foreign diplomat – alejandro cao de benos – a man of spanish descent who pulls some strings to grant longoria permission to film a documentary inside the hermit country under a number of strict conditions. although longoria is theoretically allowed to interview anyone while there, his entire itinerary is predetermined, and he is unable to leave his guides or cao de benos for the duration of the trip. what follows is an ultra-skewed portrait of north korea, a free exploration of the country without any freedom, which sees alvaro thrust into a number of eerily unrealistic situations as he attempts to draw the line between fact and fiction. it’s a somewhat conventional documentary, albeit one with unprecedented access to the most locked down nation in the world, however its major strength lies in longoria’s ability to disorient his audience, mincing fact with fiction to the extent that we no longer know what to believe. this places us in the shoes of longoria himself, who over the course of his journey becomes more and more unsure which situations are real, and which have been simulated to appease his western audience, as cao de benos and co. attempt to use longoria’s documentary as a north korean propaganda piece. in fact, the central thesis of longoria’s film hinges on a speech delivered by barack obama that questioned what effect a foreign country that was able to intimidate the usa out of the release of a satirical movie could have on externally produced documentaries. the introduction of a clip of this speech acts as the key to unlocking longoria’s message – a lack of objectivity, and knowledge that at least some of what we’re seeing is false will prevent us from ever knowing the full truth of what is fact, and what is merely a fabrication. perhaps the film’s most impressive inclusions are, then, the sparse moments where the lie begins to unravel;
94	raleigh (wtvd) -- after a two-year, $13,000,000 renovation and just two days before its scheduled to be rededicated, downtown raleigh's moore square has been vandalized.raleigh police say metal cleats designed to prevent skateboarding on the park's retaining walls were pried off and the same wall was sprayed with wax lacquer.they charged 17-year-old rafael tomas of cary with defacing a public building. that's a misdemeanor.tomas, who told abc11 he is a skateboarder, accepts responsibility for one but not both allegations."they accused me of taking off the little metal things with a crowbar. never happened. i never did that," the teenager said at his cary home with his mother by his side."the lacquer part, i was involved with that," he said. "so i'm definitely going to man up to that part. but i'm not going to take accusations for something i didn't do."although no one is allowed in the park until friday, the fencing is down and many who frequent downtown are excited about its reopening.but many of them were upset to hear there has already been vandalism.cheri krcelic, a raleigh resident who was walking her dog with her boyfriend along person street when she spotted the damage, chalked it up to youthfulness."when i was younger we didn't know any better. but now that we're older we're like you need to respect the property. we want it to look good for as long as we can," she said.tomas, who spoke exclusively to abc 11, said he and many of his skater friends don't like traditional skate parks.he says they prefer cityscapes.they enjoy the challenges of walls, sidewalks, stairs, and railings.but after taxpayers had to pay to constantly repair damage done by skateboarders who ignored rules about where to ride, cities began installing devices like the cleats to thwart the skater's efforts.and that, tomas says, angers them."kids can be on the corner smoking crack and stuff, you know. and we're out here trying to skate," he said.

97	 millaiselta tulevaisuuden eurooppalainen tuote tulee näyttämään. tulevaisuuden eurooppalainen tuote, jossa on merkintä "made in europe", tulee olemaan markkinoiden innovatiivisin, turvallisin ja energiatehokkain sekä luonnonvaroja eniten säästävä. olen vakuuttunut siitä, että euroopan unionin johtoasema energiatehokkuudessa ja luonnonvarojen säästeliäässä käytössä ei ainoastaan ole hyödyllinen ympäristön vaan myös työllistymisen kannalta. ympäristöystävälliset tuotteet ja tuotantoprosessit kukoistavat tällä hetkellä taantumasta huolimatta, ja tämä suuntaus tulee jatkumaan. minun mielestäni tämä direktiivi on hyvä esimerkki integroiduista tuotepolitiikasta. direktiivi on jo osoittautunut hyödylliseksi ja nähtävillä on tuloksia sen soveltamisesta energiaa käyttäviin tuotteisiin. direktiivi tarjoaa puitteet sellaisten ekologisen suunnittelun vaatimusten asettamiselle, joissa otetaan huomioon nykyinen tuotteiden ympäristövaikutus koko niiden elinkaaren ajalta. kuten magor imre csibi jo totesi, direktiivi viitoittaa tietä teollisuuden alan vapaaehtoiselle aloitteelle. se rajaa virallisesti tarkennetut vaatimukset koskemaan niitä tuotteita, joissa on potentiaalia merkittävään säästöön taloudellisesti kannattavalla tavalla. voimassa oleva direktiivi vaikuttaa jo nykyisellään huomattavasti euroopan unionin vähennystavoitteisiin siten, että hehkulampuista, boilereista ja monista muista energiaa tuhlaavista kulutustuotteista luovutaan. direktiivin soveltamisalan laajentaminen kaikkiin energiaan liittyviin tuotteisiin tuo valtavasti mahdollisuuksia energian kulutuksen vähentämiseksi edelleen ja näin hiilidioksidipäästöjen vähentämiseksi. jokainen tuote, jolla on merkitystä energian kulutukselle, kuuluu siis tällä hetkellä direktiivin soveltamisalaan. tähän kuuluu näin ollen myös sellaiset tuotteet, joiden käyttö ei suoraan kuluta energiaa, mutta jotka vaikuttavat epäsuorasti energian kulutukseen. niinpä nykyään voidaan esimerkiksi asettaa vaatimuksia ikkunoille sekä vettä käyttäville tuotteille. esimerkiksi pelkästään kaksinkertaisten ikkunoiden määrää lisäämällä voitaisiin säästää 30 prosenttia enemmän energiaa vuoteen 2020 mennessä. tämä vastaa 55 000 gigawattitunnin säästöä, mikä puolestaan vastaa 27 megatonnin säästöä hiilidioksidin määrässä tai kahden tai kolmen ydinvoimalan tuotantoa. tämä osoittaa valtavasta vaikutuksesta, joka merkityksettömän tuntuisilla muutoksilla voi olla. komissio aikoo jatkaa meneillään olevaa työtään, joka koskee ekologista suunnittelua koskevan direktiivin täytäntöönpanotoimia, joita on noin 25. nämä toimet kirjattiin vuosien 2009 ja 2011 välistä kautta koskevaan komission toimintasuunnitelmaan. lisäksi kuultuaan ekologista suunnittelua koskevaa kuulemisfoorumia direktiivin 16 artiklan mukaisesti komissio määrittelee, mitkä tuoteryhmät otetaan 21. lokakuuta 2011 mennessä mukaan toiseen työsuunnitelmaan. vuoteen 2012 mennessä komissio tarkistaa 21 artiklan mukaisesti myös, olisiko tarpeen laajentaa direktiivin soveltamisalaa tuotteisiin, jotka eivät ole olennaisia energian kulutuksen kannalta, mutta jotka kuitenkin vaikuttavat luonnonvarojen suojeluun. kuten sovittiin neuvotteluissa, jotka johtivat sopimukseen ensimmäisessä käsittelyssä, komissio antaa julkilausuman. tämä julkilausuma on parlamentin tiedossa. annan sen puhemiehistölle tämän istunnon jälkeen. koska ehdotus hyväksyttiin nopeasti ensimmäisessä käsittelyssä
